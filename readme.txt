== Google Analyticator ==

Google Analyticator adds the necessary JavaScript code to enable Google Analytics (http://google.com/analytics) logging. This eliminates the need to edit your template code to begin logging.

== Installation ==
Drop the google-analyticator.php file into /wp-content/plugins/, and activate the plugin.

== Usage ==
In your WordPress administration page go to Options > Google Analytics. From there enter your UID and enable logging. Information on how to obtain your UID can be found on the options page.

Once you save your settings, the JavaScript code should now be appearing on all of your WordPress pages.
